# Crystal Collector Game

This game is my Unit 4 homework submission for UT Austin's Houston Coding Bootcamp.  

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive game where the HTML is dynamically updated using the jQuery library.

Click [here](https://rchlblns.github.io/unit-4-game/) to play the game. 

## How to Play

* A random number is generated on the page
* Four gems are also displayed as buttons, each with a different hidden value
* Each time the player clicks on a button, that hidden value is added to their total score
* If the player matches their score to the random number, they win the game!
* When the game is restarted, a new random number and new gem values are assigned

## Design Notes
* Gem buttons are assigned a number between 1 - 12
* Random number generated is a number between 19 - 120
